                <h3> Energy production and consumption </h3>
                <br />
                <p> Energy deals represent about 50% of all traded weather derivatives. In France the variations in temperature account for 85% of the variance in winter
                   energy demand and 63% in summer. The negative anomaly of the air temperature in winter triggers the additional volume demand of the natural gas and the
                   electricity around 3% per 1 degree C. Few examples of financial risks related to the air temperature variations.</p>
                   <br />
                   <p> Depending on the weather anomaly and the power load, the planning of generators is re-adjusted. Cold anomaly of 1 degree C implies a greater demand
                    (better sales), but also requires the additional boost of the coal, natural gas and oil power plants, which is costly at the last moment. </p>
                   <br />
                   <p> To fulfill the volume engagements, the wind farm energy provider has to buy the expensive wholesale electricity simply because the weak or unstable winds
                   unable it's own production. Weather derivatives replenish the profit losses proportionally to the anomaly duration and intensity. </p>

                        <h3> Agricultural Commodities </h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>Persistent and repetitive bad weather conditions dictate the yield volumes and quality, the production costs and as a result the commodity prices.
                        Moreover, an excessive soil moisture triggers a higher exposure of plants to diseases and insects, which increases the demand in fertilisers and chemicals,
                        affecting their stocks and prices. The transport planning and as a result, the production cost, is also reconsidered following a regional failure in yield. </p>
                        <br />
                        <p> To support farmers when coping with the concequences of unfavorable non-extreme weather, the weather-derivatives contracts become useful. These formalise the frequency
                        and the intencity of unwelcomed events. For example, this could be the short repetitive droughts over the season, when no rainfall but high air temperatures.
                        In elevated and continental regions frost events are of concern. The anomalously long/cold winter is the most commonly traded event on agricultural commodity market.
                        <br />
                        <p> Temperature-based HDD-index reflects well the unusually cold months and seasons. Another danger in the fields are the storm-force winds and heavy showers, excluded from
                        a classic insuarance contract. Cattle and poultry producers suffer from droughts by means of the feed cost, forced to buy the grains elsewhere. The
                        list of primary goods requiring the weather-based hedging is as long as the variety of agricultural spicies. The top 10 include the oilseeds, cocoa, corn,
                        wheat, soya, sugar cane, rice, coffee, cotton, potatoes and fruits. </p>

                   <p> Consumer psychology studies confirm that the purchase intention and the number of online "to-purchase" clicks are higher when sunny and warmer.
                     The willingness to spend money doubles or even triples when the good weather comes. The actual numbers depend on the product, the region and its climate,
                     and the season. Beer sales volumes show-up to be highly correlated to the maximum daily air tempartures in Southern France. Consumption of soft drinks is 5%
                     smaller during damp and fresh summer. Warm winters are dramatic for coat sales. Non-catastrophic, but just a bad weather affects the mood of consumers and
                     the preferencial producs. Weather Trade Net offers the hedging contracts that take into account the revenue losses in the past - those affected by meteorological variations.
                    The execution of the contract depends on the actual weather measurements and does not require any proof of loss. </p>

                     with a measurable meteorological parameter, such as the air temperature, wind speed, amonut of rain, frequency of frost days, and intensity
                     the solar radiation. </p>

                  <br />
                  <p> The operational real-time weather forecasts reflect quite well the evolution in air temperature and wind over coming 3-4 days.
                    Yet, the complexity of meteorological events does not allow for a longer thermo-dynamic (physical) weather forecast. You might have heard about the seasonal
                    forecasts. These are built from historical 40-year weather records and the regional tendencies in the Sea Level Pressure. Indeed, the seasonal
                    forecasts reflect mostly some statistically based expectation rather than a real-time thermo-dynamic weather forecast. <br />
                    So far, beyond one week ahead, the future financial losses due to unpredictable weather anomaly are unpredictable as well. As a result, from day-to-day,
                    from season-to-season the temperature anomaly increases the gap between the expected revenue and the actual one. </p>

                      <p> Air temperature is the most popular and a highly reliable meteorological parameter. Observations are available all
                        over the Globe. For financial applications the daily average values are recalculated into indexes such as the cumulative <b>Heating</b>
                        (<b>HDD</b>) and the cumulative <b>Cooling Degree Days</b> (<b>CDD</b>), the <b>Heat Index</b> (<b>HI</b>), the <b>Cumulative Average Temperature</b>.
                        The <i>cumulative</i> term means that the daily air temperature anomaly is summed over a period, which can be a week, month or season.
                        Around 80% of contracts are based on either temperature index. According to a <b>swap-type contract</b>, one counter party gets paid if the degree days
                        over a specified period are greater than the strike level, and the other party gets paid if the degree days over that period are less than the strike. </p>

                  <h3>About WEATHER TRADE NET </h3>
                  <br /> <br />
                  <p> Weather Trade Net is a French StartUp launched in August 2016 by Maksimovich Elena, scientist in Geophysics, PhD in Meteorology.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Weather Trade Net combines the expertise in mathematics, meteorology, computer science and finance.
                  We furnish the tools and relevant solutions for non-extreme Weather Risk Hedging.
                  The challenge is to introduce the weather derivatives to a small-profit business.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Step-by-step, we first focus on business performance analysis in respect to weather fluctuations in the past.
                  Further, when quantifying the weather-related excessive expences (that should be covered by weather derivatives), the "strike" is evaluated as a
                  threshold between "affordable" and "excessive" profit losses. The contract premium and the maximum payoff are proportional to losses of each individual
                  business and the risk level to hedge.
                  <!-- <br /> <br />
                  Weather Trade Net assists to select an appropriate weather derivatives type, with an optimal strike value and a realistic risk pricing. -->
                  <br /> <br />
                  As an independent partner, Weather Trade Net guaranties the objective and confidential data analytics services, transparent contract set-up,
                  as well as a timely and in-depth reporting. We seek for the best compromise between a risk-seller and a risk-buyer.
